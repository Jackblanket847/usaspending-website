Recipient Parent/Child 
Larger entities with multiple locations or departments may be grouped together using parent recipient data elements. Recipient “parents” are the highest point in the hierarchy. For example, state governments and state-level agencies: “State of Texas” is the parent recipient and “Texas Department of Motor Vehicles” is the child recipient."
